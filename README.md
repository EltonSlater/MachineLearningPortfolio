# Machine Learning Portfolio
this is a portfolio containg four different examples of basic machine learning in python

## linear regression
#### this project uses linear regression to predict the FFMC of a forest fire will burn
linear regression is a form of supervised learning where correlations are represented between independant variables and with a line using the formula <i>mx + b</i> so points without data on the line can be predicted 

## K-NN
#### This project uses the K-NN algorithm to predict the class of vehicles based off other atributes
K-NN or K-nearest neighbor is a supervised learning algorithm which groups similar datapoints where K represents the number of groups and then uses these groupings to make predictions about new data

## Kmeans clustering

Kmeans clustering is a unsupervised learning algorithm where data is grouped together based on proximity which can then be used to predict future data, the variable K is used to represent the number of groups the data will be clustered in

## reinforcement learning
#### this project uses reinforcement learning in order to teach an ai to balance a stick on a swivel

reinforcement learning works by first making random choices and if those choices work towards the goal the ai is rewarded if they don't it isnt rewared the ai then attempts to use what it has learned while also trying new aproaches and once again is either rewarded or not based of the results, this repeats for as many times as you allow it untill it has learned how to do it's task
